# Text-Rendering-System
A text rendering system that renders strings as textured quads on the screen on the screen. 

Given a tab delimited file of sentences and keywords (English and French only right now), the system will organize it internally and will be able to render the sentences on screen. 

The system allows for left horizontal alignment (Default), centered horizontal alignment, and right horizontal alignment.

It also allows for top down vertical alignment (Default), centered vertical alignment, and bottom to top vertical alignment.
